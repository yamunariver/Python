# python

We choose `mnemonic variable names to help us rAn argument is a value which we can be passed or put inside the function parenthesisemember why we created the variable in the first place`. While this all sounds great, and it is a very good idea to use mnemonic variable names, mnemonic variable names can get in the way of a beginning programmer's ability to parse and understand code.

`When we assign a certain data type to a variable, it is called variable declaration`

`Assigning means storing data in the variable. The equal sign in Python is not equality as in Mathematics.`

`An argument is a value which we can be passed or put inside the function parenthesis`

print('hello')
print(len('hello'))

``


To identify the data type we use the type built-in function. `I would like to ask you to focus on understanding different data types very well`


Casting: `Converting one data type to another data type`. We use int(), float(), str(), list, set When we do arithmetic operations string numbers should be first converted to int or float otherwise it will return an error. If we concatenate a number with a string, the number should be first converted to a string. We will talk about concatenation in String section.


`Complex Numbers Example: 1 + j, 2 + 4j, 1 - 1j`

## Arithmetic Operators:
``
Addition(+): a + b
``

``
Subtraction(-): a - b
``

``
Multiplication(*): a * b
``

``
Division(/): a / b
``

``
Modulus(%): a % b
``

``
Floor division(//): a // b
``

``
Exponentiation(**): a ** b
``
