# python

We choose `mnemonic variable names to help us remember why we created the variable in the first place`. While this all sounds great, and it is a very good idea to use mnemonic variable names, mnemonic variable names can get in the way of a beginning programmer's ability to parse and understand code.

`When we assign a certain data type to a variable, it is called variable declaration`

`Assigning means storing data in the variable. The equal sign in Python is not equality as in Mathematics.`
